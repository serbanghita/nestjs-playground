You are an expert in TypeScript, NestJS, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following NestJS and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking.
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious.
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when the type is uncertain.

## General

- Organize code by feature/module
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Keep controllers thin and focused on HTTP handling
- Design services around single responsibility principle
- Keep business logic in services, not controllers
- Use feature modules to organize related functionality
- Export only necessary components
- Use dynamic modules for configuration
- Use built-in HTTP exceptions for common errors
- Create custom exception filters for specific error handling
- Use consistent pattern (active record or data mapper)
- Define proper relations and cascades between Entities
- Use custom repositories for complex queries
- Keep query methods in repositories
- Use query builder for complex joins
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Select only necessary fields in queries
- Use transactions for atomic operations
- Choose appropriate transaction isolation levels
- Use TypeORM migrations for database schema changes
- Keep migrations idempotent when possible

## NestJS Best Practices

- **Introduction**: NestJS is a framework for building efficient and scalable Node.js server-side applications, built with TypeScript. It uses robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and can be configured to use Fastify as well.
- **Controllers**: Use the CLI's CRUD generator (`nest g resource [name]`) to quickly create CRUD controllers with built-in validation. Group related routes together using a path prefix in the `@Controller()` decorator to reduce repetitive code. Use the standard, built-in method for manipulating responses; when a request handler returns a JavaScript object or array, it will be automatically serialized to JSON.
- **Providers**: Providers are a core concept in NestJS and can be services, repositories, factories, helpers, etc. Their main idea is that they can be injected as dependencies.
- **Modules**: Organize your components into feature modules to keep the codebase clean and maintainable, especially as the application grows. Use shared modules to share the same instance of any provider between multiple modules effortlessly. Every module is automatically a shared module and can be reused by any module.
- **Middleware**: Middleware is a function that is called before the route handler. It has access to the request and response objects, and the `next()` middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- **Exception filters**: NestJS has a built-in exceptions layer that handles all unhandled exceptions across an application. When an exception is not handled by your application code, it is caught by this layer, which then automatically sends an appropriate user-friendly response.
- **Pipes**: A pipe is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator, which implements the `PipeTransform` interface. Pipes have two typical use cases: transformation and validation.
- **Guards**: A guard is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator, which implements the `CanActivate` interface. Guards have a single responsibility: they determine whether a given request will be handled by the route handler or not, depending on certain conditions (like permissions, roles, ACLs, etc.) present at run-time. This is often referred to as authorization.
- **Interceptors**: An interceptor is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator that implements the `NestInterceptor` interface. They make it possible to bind extra logic before/after method execution, transform the result returned from a function, transform the exception thrown from a function, extend the basic function behavior, or completely override a function depending on specific conditions.
- **Decorators**: Nest is built around decorators. You can create your own custom decorators to make your code more readable and transparent, especially when you need to extract properties from the request object.

## Fundamentals

- **Custom providers and Dependency Injection**: Dependency injection is an inversion of control (IoC) technique wherein you delegate instantiation of dependencies to the IoC container (in our case, the NestJS runtime system), instead of doing it in your own code imperatively.
- **Injection scopes**: For people coming from different programming language backgrounds, it might be unexpected to learn that in Nest, almost everything is shared across incoming requests. However, there are edge cases when request-based lifetime may be the desired behavior, for instance, per-request caching in GraphQL applications, request tracking, and multi-tenancy. Injection scopes provide a mechanism to obtain the desired provider lifetime behavior.
- **Testing**: Automated testing is considered an essential part of any serious software development effort. Nest provides integration with Jest and Supertest out-of-the-box, while remaining agnostic to testing tools.
- **Lifecycle Events**: A Nest application, as well as every application element, has a lifecycle managed by Nest. Nest provides lifecycle hooks that give visibility into key lifecycle events, and the ability to act when they occur.
- **Asynchronous providers**: The application start can be delayed until one or more asynchronous tasks are completed, like establishing a database connection.
- **Circular dependency**: A circular dependency occurs when two classes depend on each other. While circular dependencies should be avoided where possible, you can't always do so. In such cases, Nest enables resolving circular dependencies between providers in two ways: forward referencing and using the `ModuleRef` class.
- **Discovery service**: The `DiscoveryService` allows developers to dynamically inspect and retrieve providers, controllers, and other metadata within a NestJS application, which is useful when building plugins, decorators, or advanced features that rely on runtime introspection.
- **Dynamic modules**: Dynamic modules provide an API for importing one module into another, and customizing the properties and behavior of that module when it is imported.
- **Execution context**: Nest provides utility classes that help make it easy to write applications that function across multiple application contexts (e.g., HTTP server-based, microservices and WebSockets). These utilities provide information about the current execution context which can be used to build generic guards, filters, and interceptors.
- **Lazy loading modules**: By default, modules are eagerly loaded. Lazy loading can help decrease bootstrap time by loading only modules required by the specific serverless function invocation.
- **Module reference**: The `ModuleRef` class allows you to navigate the internal list of providers and obtain a reference to any provider using its injection token as a lookup key.
- **Platform agnosticism**: Nest is a platform-agnostic framework. This means you can develop reusable logical parts that can be used across different types of applications.

## Techniques

- **Configuration**: The `@nestjs/config` package is used for managing configuration variables. It internally uses `dotenv`.
- **Logger**: NestJS comes with a built-in text-based logger which is used during application bootstrapping and several other circumstances. You can also make use of the built-in logger, or create your own custom implementation, to log your own application-level events and messages.
- **HTTP module**: The built-in `HttpModule` wraps Axios and exposes it via the `HttpService` class.

## TypeORM

- **TypeORM Integration**: For integrating with SQL and NoSQL databases, Nest provides the `@nestjs/typeorm` package.
- **Postgres Configuration**: To connect to a PostgreSQL database, use the `postgres` data source type. The default port is `5432`.
- **Performance and Optimization**:
    - **Avoid the N+1 Query Problem**: Use `leftJoinAndSelect` or `innerJoinAndSelect` to combine tables in a single query instead of executing multiple queries.
    - **Use `getRawMany` or `getRawOne`**: When you don't need to map data to entities, `getRawMany` and `getRawOne` can be more efficient.
    - **Indexing**: Use indexes to speed up query execution. You can create an index on a single column or a combination of columns.
    - **Lazy vs. Eager Loading**: TypeORM provides two main methods for loading data relations: Lazy Loading and Eager Loading. Each has a different impact on the performance of your application. Lazy loading loads the relation data only when needed, reducing database load when all related data isn't always necessary.
